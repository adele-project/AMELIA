# AMELIA - Argument Mining Evaluation on Legal documents in ItAlian: A CALAMITA Challenge

This repository contains 225 Italian decisions on Value Added Tax (VAT), annotated in xml, to identify and categorize argumentative text. 
Based on this data, we propose three tasks for the CALAMITA challenge: the objective of the first task is to classify each argumentative component as premise or conclusion, while the second and third tasks aim at classifying the type of premise (legal vs factual), and its argumentative scheme.
